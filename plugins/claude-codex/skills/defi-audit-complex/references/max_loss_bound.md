# Max Loss Bound Worksheet

Use this to quantify worst‑case loss per asset and per path.

## For each asset
- **Path**: function or sequence that can move funds.
- **Max loss per tx**: absolute bound.
- **Max loss per block/epoch**: bound with batching.
- **Guards**: caps, circuit breakers, role checks.
- **Mitigation**: required change if bound is too high.
