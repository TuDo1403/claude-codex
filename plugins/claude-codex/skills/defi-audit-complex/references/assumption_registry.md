# Assumption Registry

Use this to capture and validate all trust assumptions.

## Template
- **Assumption**: what is trusted.
- **Risk if false**: impact and likelihood.
- **Verification**: tested / verified / unverified.
- **Mitigation**: fallback or circuit breaker.

## Examples
- Oracle is honest and updates within X seconds.
- Timelock delay is always enforced.
- Keeper set is sufficiently decentralized.
