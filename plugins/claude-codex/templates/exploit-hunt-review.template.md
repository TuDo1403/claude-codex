## Invariant Coverage

| Invariant | Expression | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|--------|----------|
| IC-1 | [expression] | [COVERED/UNCLEAR/VIOLATED] | [where enforced] |
| IC-2 | [expression] | [status] | [evidence] |
| IS-1 | [expression] | [status] | [evidence] |
| IA-1 | [expression] | [status] | [evidence] |
| IT-1 | [expression] | [status] | [evidence] |
| IB-1 | [expression] | [status] | [evidence] |

**Summary:** X COVERED, Y UNCLEAR, Z VIOLATED

### Status Legend:
- **COVERED** - Code clearly enforces this invariant
- **UNCLEAR** - Enforcement not obvious, needs clarification
- **VIOLATED** - Found code that breaks this invariant

## Required Tests

*Tests needed to prove invariants or prevent regressions.*

| Invariant | Required Test | Type | Description |
|-----------|---------------|------|-------------|
| [I#] | [test name] | [Unit/Fuzz/Invariant] | [what it tests] |

## Economic/MEV Risks

| Risk | Severity | Description | Mitigation Needed |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Sandwich | [HIGH/MED/LOW] | [description] | [Yes/No - what] |
| Flash loan | [severity] | [description] | [mitigation] |
| Front-running | [severity] | [description] | [mitigation] |
| Price manipulation | [severity] | [description] | [mitigation] |

---

## DoS/Gas Grief Risks

| Risk | Severity | Description | Mitigation Needed |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Unbounded loop | [HIGH/MED/LOW] | [description] | [Yes/No - what] |
| State bloat | [severity] | [description] | [mitigation] |
| Block gas limit | [severity] | [description] | [mitigation] |
| Griefing via revert | [severity] | [description] | [mitigation] |

## Notes

*Additional observations, suspicious patterns, areas needing attention.*

[Notes here]

## Blindness Verification

- [x] Reviewed from bundle-stage4 only
- [x] Did NOT see threat-model.md prose (attack descriptions, trust assumptions)
- [x] Did NOT see design.md narrative
- [x] Used only invariants-list.md and public-api.md for context
- [x] Hunted based on code patterns, not spec hints
